# 1.  Mandelstam Variables (10 points).

**Consider the two-to-two scattering of massless particles (which may be the same or different), with incoming momenta $p_{1,2}^\mu$ and outgoing momenta $p_{1,2}^\mu$. Compute the Mandelstam variables in terms of the center-of-mass (CM) energies of the incoming particles, $E$, and CM scattering angle, Î¸:**

Remember that massless particles don't have a squared momentum,

$$
p_{i}^2=0.
$$

So only the cross terms of the Mandelstam variables with remain,

$$
\begin{align}
s &= \cancel{p_{1}^2} + 2p_{1}^\mu p_{2 \mu} + \cancel{p_{2}^2}  \\
t &= \cancel{p_{1}^2} - 2p_{1}^\mu p_{3 \mu} + \cancel{p_{3}^2} \\
u &= \cancel{p_{1}^2} - 2p_{1}^\mu p_{4 \mu} + \cancel{p_{4}^2}
\end{align}
$$
