# 1. Hadronization: Rapidity plateau (20 points).

**When quarks and gluons fragment into jets, the soft particles created during the fragmentation process are produced in colored flux tubes. This means they have limited transverse momentum with respect to the *jet axis* and that they are produced uniformly in longitudinal phase space. A consequence of this is that production is uniform in rapidity**

$$
y = \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(
    \frac{
        E+p_{||}
        }{
        E-p_{||}
    } 
\right)~,
$$

**where $p_{||}$ is the particle's momentum with respect to the jet axis.**

## a.

**Show that a particleâ€™s rapidity is related to its velocity along the jet axis $\beta_{||}$ by the expression**

$$
y = \tanh^{-1}(\beta_{||})~.
$$

We know first off that $E=\gamma m$ and $p_{||}=\gamma \beta_{||} m$.
After subbing in and cancelling line terms, we get

$$
y = \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(
    \frac{
        1 + \beta_{||}
        }{
        1 - \beta_{||}
    } 
\right)~,
$$
