I was unable to do much last session, so I will just quote what I wrote on Friday:

>Following advice from Christina, now just running the newer set (Aram's) on both codes. See where we get.

So, I will run on Aram's sample set and Christina's bkg set, on both V2 and V3 (old and new) cutflow table codes. Then I will put the resulting cutflows through the branching ratio limit code.

I use the following calculation for the signal yield (`N_sig`), bkg yield (`N_bkg`), and the branching ratio limit (`BR`):
```python
for i, new_ctau in enumerate(ctau_list):
	weight_terms = (old_ctau/new_ctau) * np.exp(gLLP_ctau*(1/old_ctau - 1/new_ctau))
	weight = np.sum(weight_terms)
	new_nEvents[i] = weight

N_sig = muonfiltereff * genfiltereff[dataset] * new_nEvents * xsec * lumi / nEvents[dataset][dem_cut]
		
N_bkg = N_bb_p * N_bb * nEvents['background'][num_cut]/nEvents['background'][dem_cut] 

BR = 2 * np.sqrt(N_bkg)/N_sig
        ```

The only operational difference is the two cutflow codes that produced the cutflows. The sample and bkg set are the same. **Note that this is done without taking `muon_SF` into account because only one of the cutflow codes makes a column for that.** The limit is over-optimistic as a result.

And so the result is:

As we can see, these are basically identical. Just to be a little more scientific about it, here's the plot of the ratios of the left and right plot above:

There's maybe a 5% difference between the two, so we can rule out the discrepancy being the difference in the cutflow code.

This leaves, I think, the problem now is something with the sample set.
