### To recap the study

There's a plot from October 2022 that shows the BR limits to bottom out at a little less than $~10^{-4}$:

Plots made with a more modern version of the sample set bottom out with a BR limit at around just under $10^{-6}$ (plot on left):

These plots should look the same, but they do not. 

These are where the breaking points could be:
1. There are two different codes for generating the BR limits from the cutflow code output
2. There are two different codes for generating the cutflow table
3. There are two different sample sets

We found that the background yield (`N_bkg`) was probably calculated incorrectly for the jan 2023 branching ratio plot because it was created using Aram's newer sample set, while the older oct 2022 plot was created using christina's older sample set. For this older sample set we assume that we ran through 2% of the b-parking dataset to make the background, while we don't actually have a concrete number for Aram's set. I erroneously assumed that it would be 2%.

This snippet was used for both october 22 and january 2023 plots, when they should each have a different value of `N_bb_p`, which represents the percentage of the p-parking dataset run through.

```python
N_bb_p = .02

N_bkg = N_bb_p * N_bb * nEvents['background'][num_cut]/nEvents['background'][dem_cut]
```
A work around for this was to use Christina's bkg set to calculate this background yield.


Another problem is that for the the jan 2023 plot, I should have taken the LLP gen filtering into account since the sample set create by Aram is LLP gen filtered. I did not do this.

Finally, I tested to see if the difference in cutflow code could be a reason for the discrepancy, but found that using Aram's sample and running it through both [cutflow codes produces the same results](/B-parking/Mon_Apr_17_2023.md), discounting that theory.

So in summary, there were two major problems:
1. Incorrectly handling the differences between Christina's and Aram's bkg sets. There is no reason to believe they were run on the same amount of b-parking data.
2. Not taking the LLP gen filtering done in Aram's sample set into account

I feel very close to wrapping this up.
