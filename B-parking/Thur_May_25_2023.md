Today I need to make a histogram of `dtRechitCluster_match_RPCBx_dPhi0p5` for background (and maybe signal?).

I'll try to do this in UAF.

This is the sample directory:

```
root://cmsxrootd.fnal.gov//store/user/ddiaz/B-Parking/V1p19_1
```

and these are the samples:

```
BToKPhi_MuonLLPDecayGenFilter_PhiToPi0Pi0_mPhi0p3_ctau300/BToKPhi_MuonLLPDecayGenFilter_PhiToPi0Pi0_mPhi0p3_ctau300.root
ParkingBPH4_2018A/ParkingBPH4_2018A.root
```

Doing this on UAF is not working as expected. Moving on to LPC.
