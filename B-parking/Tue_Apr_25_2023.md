I'm having a bit of an organizing and naming problem. To make it a little easier, I will try to standardize the terminology here.

Let's name things by the "era" they were produced and used. They correspond to the dates of the talks Aram and I gave in the EXO meeting.
* `oct_2022`
* `jan_2023`

So the cutflow codes, the signal samples, and the background, each have two(ish) versions corresponding to those dates given above. I also define a **third date** for the background (`apr_2023`) for reasons that will be important later.

These categories determine the details of how the BR limit is calculated.
* `oct_2022` cutflow code does not include SF
	* so BR for both `oct_2022` signal and `jan_2023` signal can be calculated, just without SF
* `jan_2023` cutflow code does include SF
	* so BR for `oct_2022` cannot be generated
