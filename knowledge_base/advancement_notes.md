## First iteration

I'm trying to write a presentation for my PhD candidacy advancement. The topic is "Searches for Long Lived Particles in the Muon Detectors and New Machine Learning Developments". I need to have about 40 slides for this presentation. I need to talk about the following topics:

* Title slide
* The standard model
* the lhc
	* cms
	* the sub detectors
	* the trigger system
	* the muon system
	* high luminosity upgrade coming soon
* long lived particles
	* different models
* why cms is well suited for long lived particles
* why it isnt
* past searches of llps
* current limits and constraints
* proposed analysis 
	* with higgs portal
	* explain higgs portal
	* using the bparking dataset 
	* explain what the bparking dataset is
	* prelimenaries
* Talk about machine learning
	* we can use machine learning in the correlator trigger
	* these can help trigger on potential LLP events
	* talk about how graph neural networks have already been shown to be good at discriminating jets
	* ml can be faster
	* maybe we can use them in the triggers especially now that the high luminosity upgrade will be greatly increasing the data rate

Can you write me an outline for 40 slides?

## second iteration

Sure, here is a tentative outline for 40 slides to cover all the topics you've mentioned.

	* Implications for future research.

00. SM Dead End
* Absence of clear experimental hints for new physics
* Crucial to explore new strategies with minimal theoretical prejudice.
- A key concept for exploration is "dark" or "hidden" sectors 
* Consist of particles that are neutral or have suppressed interactions with the Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions.
- Prevalent in various BSM scenarios and can involve suppressed couplings or heavy mediator particles that connect to the SM.
- "Higgs portal" is particularly interesting as sector's properties are not yet fully understood
- new states may interact with it
- Experiments capable of studying the Higgs boson offer natural laboratories for new physics searches
- To cover the broad range of possibilities in hidden sectors, it is essential to employ model-independent search strategies

00. Long lived particles
- Suppressed dark-SM couplings or heavy mediators can lead to long lifetimes for light particles in the hidden sector due to reduced total widths from small couplings, mediator mass, loops, or phase space effects.
- This scenario is common in models involving Dark Matter, Baryogenesis, Supersymmetry, or Neutral Naturalness.
- In the SM, examples of long lifetimes are observed in particles like K0 L, π±, neutron, and muon, whose widths are suppressed by weak interaction scales required for flavor-changing processes and phase space considerations.
- Hidden sectors can manifest as distinct signatures in LHC collisions, particularly through the displaced decay-in-flight of these long-lived particles (LLPs) in the hidden sector.
