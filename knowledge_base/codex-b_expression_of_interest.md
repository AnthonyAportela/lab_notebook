## Introduction 

### Motivation

- The search for New Physics (NP) at the LHC and other experiments is driven by the need to address fundamental questions and puzzles in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter, the dynamics of the weak scale, and the mechanism of baryogenesis.
- Despite the absence of clear experimental hints for NP and increasing tensions in popular BSM extensions, it is crucial to explore new strategies and diversify LHC search programs with minimal theoretical prejudice.
- One key aspect is the exploration of "dark" or "hidden" sectors that consist of particles that are neutral or have suppressed interactions with the Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions.
- Hidden sectors are prevalent in various BSM scenarios and can involve suppressed couplings or heavy mediator particles that connect to the SM.
- The "Higgs portal" is particularly interesting as the Higgs sector's properties are not yet fully understood, and new states may interact with it. Experiments capable of studying the Higgs boson offer natural laboratories for NP searches.
- To cover the broad range of possibilities in hidden sectors, it is essential to employ model-independent search strategies.
- Suppressed dark-SM couplings or heavy mediators can lead to long lifetimes for light particles in the hidden sector due to reduced total widths from small couplings, mediator mass, loops, or phase space effects.
- This scenario is common in models involving Dark Matter, Baryogenesis, Supersymmetry, or Neutral Naturalness.
- In the SM, examples of long lifetimes are observed in particles like K0 L, π±, neutron, and muon, whose widths are suppressed by weak interaction scales required for flavor-changing processes and phase space considerations.
- Hidden sectors can manifest as distinct signatures in LHC collisions, particularly through the displaced decay-in-flight of these long-lived particles (LLPs) in the hidden sector.
- CODEX-b, by searching for LLP decays, has the potential to significantly improve the reach for a wide range of well-motivated NP scenarios, surpassing the potential gains from increased luminosity in existing detectors.

### Experimental Requirements

- In any NP scenario, the decay width of a long-lived particle (LLP) can strongly depend on unknown ratios of physical scales, resulting in a broad range of potential LLP lifetimes.
- The LHC can explore LLP masses ranging from several MeV up to O(1) TeV, with proper lifetimes up to 0.1 seconds before conflicts with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis arise.
- Experimental coverage of LLP searches depends on factors such as the center-of-mass energy available, fiducial detector volume, distance from the interaction point (IP), triggering limitations, and background levels.
- Light LLP searches require a shielded, background-free detector environment.
- LLP production channels, including decays of heavy parent particles like the Higgs, require sufficient partonic center-of-mass energy (√s) to produce a significant number of these heavy parents.
- The morphology of LLP decays also affects experimental coverage. Simple scenarios involve 2-body LLP decays to charged SM particles like +−, π+π−, or K+K−. However, many well-motivated benchmark scenarios involve more complex final states, including missing energy, photons, or high-multiplicity softer final states.
- Reconstructing missing energy final states requires track momentum measurements, detecting photons necessitates a calorimeter or pre-shower component, and identifying high-multiplicity final states requires suppressing soft hadronic backgrounds.
- The CODEX-b detector concept, described below, is well-suited to reconstruct both simple 2-body decays and more complex LLP decay morphologies.

### Baseline Detector Concept: CODEX-b

- CODEX-b is proposed to be located in the UX85 cavern, approximately 25 meters from interaction point 8 (IP8), with a fiducial volume of 10 m×10 m×10 m.
- The fiducial volume is defined by specific coordinate ranges in the x, y, and z directions.
- Passive shielding is provided partially by the existing UXA wall, supplemented by active vetos and additional passive shielding closer to the IP.
- Efficiencies for tracking and vertex reconstruction are crucial, considering there will be no magnetic field in the CODEX-b fiducial volume.
- Particle identification, mass reconstruction, and event reconstruction capabilities are necessary to confirm the presence of exotic physics, reject mis-modeled backgrounds, and enable LLP detection programs.
- The baseline CODEX-b design employs Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) tracking stations with O(100) ps timing resolution.
- To achieve good signal efficiency and background rejection, a hermetic detector configuration is utilized, with six RPC layers on each surface and five additional triplets of RPC layers spaced along the depth of the detector.
- More ambitious options under consideration involve the use of RPCs along with large-scale calorimeter technologies such as liquid or plastic scintillators.
- These advanced options would enhance particle identification, enable the measurement of decay modes involving neutral final states, and improve background rejection techniques.
- The baseline CODEX-b concept relies on proven and well-understood tracking and timing technologies, providing reliable estimates and simulations of net reconstruction efficiencies.
- Background simulations are based on well-measured SM transverse production cross-sections, and the response of the UXA radiation wall and additional shielding materials to SM particles is well understood.
- The proposed location behind the UXA radiation wall allows for regular maintenance during technical or other stops.
- Data-driven determinations from a demonstrator detector, CODEX-β, are essential to validate the reconstruction efficiencies and calibrate relevant backgrounds.


### Search Power, Complementarities, and Unique Features

- The ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments, although not explicitly designed for LLP searches, have been successful in exploring a significant region of the LLP parameter space.
- Discriminating variables for triggering and background rejection often rely on the energy deposited and the number of tracks associated with the displaced vertex.
- The reach of existing experiments, such as ATLAS and CMS, may be limited for low-mass LLPs that are not highly energetic, particularly when they decay in the muon systems due to penetration of hadrons and reduced trigger efficiency.
- Beam dump experiments (e.g., SHiP, NA62 in beam-dump mode, FASER) and forward experiments offer advantages by employing passive and/or active shielding to attenuate SM backgrounds, enabling excellent reach for light LLPs produced at relatively low center-of-mass energy.
- However, these approaches have limitations in terms of partonic center-of-mass energy, which hinders sensitivity to heavier LLPs or LLPs primarily produced through heavy portals (e.g., Higgs decays).
- Proposals for shielded, transverse, background-free detectors like MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, and AL3X aim to operate at low pseudorapidity η with more significant shielding compared to the muon systems of ATLAS and CMS.
- Such detectors overcome background rejection and triggering challenges even for low-mass LLPs but may have reduced geometric acceptance and/or luminosity.
- The effective coverage of existing and proposed experiments can be summarized as follows:
	1. ATLAS & CMS: Heavy LLPs (mLLP ≥ 10 GeV) for all lifetimes (cτ ≥ 10^7 m). Transverse detectors (CODEX-b, MATHUSLA, AL3X, etc.).
	2. LHCb: Short-to-medium lifetimes (cτ ≤ 1 m) for light LLPs (0.1 GeV ≤ mLLP ≤ 10 GeV).
	3. Forward/beam dump detectors (FASER, NA62, SHiP): Medium-to-long lifetime regime (0.1 ≤ cτ ≤ 10^7 m) for light LLPs (few GeV ≤ mLLP) with low √s production channels.
	4. Shielded, transversely displaced detectors (MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, AL3X): Relatively light LLPs (10-100 GeV) in the long lifetime regime (1 cτ ≤ 10^7 m) and high √s production channels.
- Fig. 4 provides a visual schematic summarizing the coverage of different LLP search strategies and proposals in the LLP mass, lifetime, and √s parameter space, illustrating their complementarity and unique features.
- CODEX-b has the ability to probe unique regions of parameter space beyond the existing LHC detectors, covering a wide range of well-motivated models and portals.
- While larger-scale detector proposals like MATHUSLA and AL3X explore even broader parameter ranges, CODEX-b offers a more manageable and cost-effective alternative with good LLP sensitivity, allowing for additional subsystems like precision tracking and calorimetry.
- The proximity of CODEX-b to the LHCb interaction point (IP8) and the trigger-less readout of LHCb enable straightforward integration into the LHCb readout for triggering and event reconstruction, a unique capability not available to other proposed LLP experiments at the LHC interaction points.
- The experimental design drivers and sensitivity for different models are further discussed in Sec. V.

### Timeline

- The CODEX-β demonstrator detector is proposed to be operational during Run 3.
- CODEX-b, the full version of the detector, along with other proposals like FASER2, SHiP, MATHUSLA, and AL3X, are planned to operate in Runs 4 or 5 during the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) phase.
- Fig. 5 provides the nominal timeline for CODEX-β and CODEX-b.
- Results and lessons learned from CODEX-β are expected to inform the final design choices for the full detector (CODEX-b) and may impact the evolution of the timeline.
- The modest size of CODEX-b, the accessibility of the DELPHI cavern, and the use of proven technologies in the baseline design contribute to lower construction and maintenance costs, as well as a relatively short construction timescale.
- It is important to note that CODEX-b can provide complementary data, both in reach and timing, at a relatively low cost, in relation to potential discoveries in more ambitious proposals, if they are built, as well as to existing LHC experiments.


## Physics Case

### Theory Survey Strategies

- Long-lived particles (LLPs) are generic in theories with a hierarchy of mass scales and/or couplings.
- Two complementary strategies are employed to survey the theory space:
	1. Studying minimal models or "portals" where the Standard Model is extended with a single new particle that is inert under SM gauge interactions. These minimal models are predictive and relatively small in number.
	2. Studying complete models that aim to address outstanding problems of the Standard Model, such as the gauge hierarchy problem, baryogenesis, or the nature of dark matter. These complete models feature LLPs as a consequence of the proposed mechanisms.

### Novel Studies

- While some of the models discussed in this section have been studied elsewhere, several studies contain new and novel results specific to CODEX-b.
- Notable mentions include:
	1. The axion-like particles (ALPs) minimal model, which includes new contributions to ALP production from parton fragmentation, enhancing production estimates and reaches compared to previous literature.
	2. The heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) minimal model, which incorporates modest corrections to the HNL lifetime and τ branching ratios compared to prior treatments.
	3. The neutral naturalness complete model, which is recast for CODEX-b from previous studies.
	4. The coscattering dark matter complete model, which involves LLPs produced through an exotic Z decay and has not been studied previously.

### Minimal Models

- The minimal model approach is based on the fact that the symmetries of the Standard Model already impose restrictions on the portals through which a new, neutral state can interact with our sector.
- Minimal models are classified based on whether the new particle is a scalar (S), pseudo-scalar (a), fermion (N), or vector (A). Each case has a few allowed operators of dimension 4 or lower (dimension 5 for pseudo-scalar) based on gauge invariance.
- The most common minimal models and their corresponding operators include:
	- Abelian hidden sector: $F_{\mu \nu}F^\prime_{\mu \nu}$, $hA_{\mu}A^\prime_{\mu}$
	- Scalar-Higgs portal: $S^2H^\dagger H$, $S H^{\dagger}H$ 
	- Heavy neutral leptons: $\tilde{H}\bar{L}N$
	- Axion-like particles: $\partial^{\mu}a\bar{\psi}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\psi$, $aW_{\mu \nu}\tilde{W}^{\mu \nu}$, $aB_{\mu \nu}\tilde{B}^{\mu \nu}$, $aG_{\mu \nu}\tilde{G}^{\mu \nu}$
- Cases where different operators are responsible for the production and decay of the LLP are considered.
- Fig. 6 summarizes the model space for axion-like particles (ALPs) in terms of UV operators, which fully specifies both the ALP production and decay modes.

### Abelian Hidden Sector

- The Abelian hidden sector model is a simple extension of the Standard Model.
- It consists of an additional, massive U(1) gauge boson (A) and its corresponding Higgs boson (H).
- The A and H can mix with the SM photon and Higgs boson, respectively, providing portals to the hidden sector.
- When the mass of H is heavier than the SM Higgs, it decouples from the phenomenology, and only the relevant operators in (1a) remain in the low energy effective theory.
- The mixing of A with the photon through the FµνFµν operator results in a millicharged coupling of A to all charged SM fermions.
- The mixing with the photon alone can induce both the production and decay of A in a correlated manner, which has been extensively studied.
- CODEX-b is not sensitive to this scenario due to the required large couplings, resulting in an A lifetime too short to reach the detector.
- However, the LHCb VELO and various forward detectors are expected to greatly improve the reach for this scenario.
- The hAµAµ operator, controlled by the mixing of H with the SM Higgs, induces the exotic Higgs decay h → AA.
- In the limit where the mixing with the photon is small, this becomes the dominant production mode for A, which then decays through the kinetic mixing portal to SM states.
- CODEX-b has good sensitivity to this mixing due to its transverse location and high √ˆs.
- The coupling to the Higgs and the mixing with the photon are independent parameters, allowing the A lifetime and h → AA branching ratio to be parameterized.
- Fig. 7 shows the reach of CODEX-b, AL3X, and MATHUSLA for different A mass values, as well as the reach of ATLAS and CMS.
- The muon spectrometers in ATLAS and CMS have the largest fiducial acceptance and shielding, contributing to their projected reach.
- Extrapolation of ATLAS results for the high mass benchmark to the full HL-LHC dataset is based on searches for one displaced vertex (1DV) and two displaced vertices (2DV) with 13 TeV data.
- The expected limits for the 1DV and 2DV searches are rescaled based on assumptions of background scaling and systematic uncertainties.
- The maximum reach of CODEX-b is largely insensitive to the A mass after rescaling cτ to account for differences in boost distributions, while higher masses generate more activity in the muon spectrometers of ATLAS and CMS, aiding in reducing SM backgrounds.

### Scalar-Higgs Portal

- The minimal extension of the SM involves adding a single, real scalar degree of freedom (S) to the Lagrangian.
- The Lagrangian includes terms for the SM, the free S field, the mixing of S with the Higgs boson (A_SH†H), and the quartic coupling (λS^2H†H/2).
- LHCb has shown sensitivity to this model, and CODEX-b would significantly extend its reach into the small coupling/long lifetime regime.
- The parameter A_S can be exchanged for the mixing angle sinθ between S and the physical Higgs boson eigenstate.
- In the mass eigenbasis, the light scalar inherits the couplings of the SM Higgs but with suppressed values due to sinθ.
- The couplings induced by Higgs mixing contribute to the production cross-section and decay of S.
- The dominant production mode for S, when mK < mS < mB, is through the b → s penguin process with the virtual top quark in the loop.
- If the quartic coupling λ is non-zero, additional contributions come from a penguin with an off-shell Higgs boson and direct Higgs decays.
- Fig. 9 shows the reach of CODEX-b for two choices of λ, as well as the limits from LHCb and CHARM, and projections for MATHUSLA, FASER2, SHiP, AL3X, and LHCb.
- The limits from LHCb are extrapolated assuming that the large lifetime signal region remains background-free with the HL-LHC dataset.
- The scalar-Higgs portal is a very constraining model due to its minimality.
- Relaxing the assumptions of the model, particularly the full correlation between the lifetime and the production rate (b → s S branching ratio), is worthwhile when studying LLPs produced in B decays.
- Fig. 10 shows the CODEX-b reach in the b → s S branching ratio for several benchmark LLP mass points, compared to current and projected limits for B → K(*)νν.
- CODEX-b's reach depends on the total branching ratio to charged tracks, rather than the branching ratio to muons, as in LHCb.
- The CODEX-β detector proposed for Run 3 also has sensitivity to the b → s S branching ratio, as shown in Fig. 29.
- This reach is estimated under the requirement of at least four tracks in the final state to control relevant backgrounds.
