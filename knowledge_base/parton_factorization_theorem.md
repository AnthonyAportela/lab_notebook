The Factorization theorem is a fundamental result in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which allows the separation of long-distance (non-perturbative) and short-distance (perturbative) effects in high-energy scattering processes involving hadrons. In essence, it states that the cross section for a hard-scattering process involving hadrons can be factorized into two parts: the parton distribution functions (PDFs), which describe the non-perturbative long-distance physics of the hadrons, and the perturbative short-distance partonic cross sections, which can be calculated using perturbative QCD.

Mathematically, the Factorization theorem can be expressed as:

$$
\sigma_{AB \to X} = \sum_{a, b} \int dx_a \int dx_b \, f_{a/A}(x_a, Q^2) \, f_{b/B}(x_b, Q^2) \, \hat{\sigma}_{ab \to X}(x_a, x_b, Q^2)
$$

In this formula:

- $\sigma_{AB \to X}$ is the total cross section for the process $AB \to X$, where $A$ and $B$ are the initial hadrons and $X$ is the final state.
- $a$ and $b$ denote the interacting partons (quarks, antiquarks, or gluons) inside the hadrons $A$ and $B$, respectively.
- $f_{a/A}(x_a, Q^2)$ and $f_{b/B}(x_b, Q^2)$ are the parton distribution functions for partons $a$ and $b$ inside hadrons $A$ and $B$, respectively, which depend on the longitudinal momentum fractions $x_a$ and $x_b$, and the momentum transfer scale $Q^2$.
- $\hat{\sigma}_{ab \to X}(x_a, x_b, Q^2)$ is the partonic cross section for the process $ab \to X$, which depends on the longitudinal momentum fractions $x_a$, $x_b$, and the momentum transfer scale $Q^2$.
