### Introduction

- Spontaneously broken gauge theories have a Higgs sector responsible for symmetry breaking.
- Physical scalar Higgs bosons exist with masses that are unconstrained.
- The Minimal Standard Model has one Higgs particle, but extensions of the Standard Model can have more.
- Decay channels for a Higgs particle with a mass below 1 GeV and above twice the pion mass are $\pi\pi$ and $\mu^+ \mu^-$.
- Calculation of decay rates into these channels is not straightforward, leading to confusion in the literature.
- This paper aims to resolve the issue by considering form factors in the $H\to \pi\pi$ decay.
- Next-to-leading order chiral description and dispersion theory are combined to analyze the decay amplitude.
- Chiral low-energy theorems by Voloshin and collaborators are extended to the next-to-leading order.
- Higher-order terms in the chiral expansion of the $I=0$ S-wave are significant at a low energy.
- Dispersion relations are used to extend the results to higher energy, with subtraction constants determined by chiral low-energy theorems.
- Uncertainty in the procedure is examined based on different parametrizations of the pion scattering data.
- Reasonably accurate determination of scalar form factors relevant for Higgs decay is obtained.
- Results can be applied to alternate theories of the Higgs sector with different combinations of form factors.

### Section 1: Hadronic Form Factors and Decay Rate Prediction

- Hadronic form factors are essential for predicting the decay rate of scalar Higgs bosons.
- Non-standard generalizations are considered.
- Next-to-leading order corrections to the low-energy theorems of chiral symmetry are calculated.
- Dispersion relations are used to determine the couplings at higher energy.

### Section 2: Chiral Low-Energy Theorems for $H\to \pi\pi$ Amplitudes

- The $H\to \pi\pi$ amplitudes are governed by chiral low-energy theorems.
- Voloshin and collaborators discovered a set of chiral low-energy theorems for the very low-energy behavior.
- Extension of these theorems to the next-to-leading order is done, incorporating loop diagrams, unitarity effects, and the contribution of the operator $m_s \bar{s}s$.
- Higher-order terms in the chiral expansion of the $I=0$ S-wave are significant at a low energy.

### Section 3: Merging Chiral Description and Dispersion Theory

- The prime innovation of the work is the simultaneous use of a next-to-leading order chiral description and dispersion theory.
- Chiral low-energy theorems are used to fix the subtraction constants in dispersion relations.
- Results obtained from this merging approach provide a reasonably accurate determination of the scalar form factors relevant for Higgs decay.

### Section 4: Uncertainty Analysis and Parametrization of Pion Scattering Data

- Different parametrizations of the pion scattering data are considered to examine the uncertainty in the procedure.
- The impact of various parametrizations on the determination of scalar form factors is relatively small.

### Section 5: Application to Alternate Theories of the Higgs Sector

- The presented results can be applied to alternate theories of the Higgs sector.
- Different combinations of the obtained form factors may enter these alternate theories.

### Section 2: Higgs Boson Coupling and Decay

- Within the Standard Model, the coupling of the Higgs boson to fermions is proportional to the fermion mass.
- The coupling is described by the Lagrangian term: $\mathcal{L} \supset -m_f \left(1 + \frac{H}{v}\right) \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f$.
- Here, $v=246$ GeV and $H$ represents the Higgs field.
- Calculation of the decay rates for leptons is straightforward.
- The decay rate for $H\to l^+l^-$ is given by the equation:

$$
\Gamma(H\to l^+l^-) = \frac{\sqrt{2}G_{F}}{8\pi} m^2_{l}m_{H} \left(1 - \frac{4M^2_{l}}{m^2_{H}}\right)^{3/2}
$$

- QCD radiative corrections have an important effect on quarks.
- Heavy quarks can influence light hadronic couplings through their couplings to gluons.
- Perturbative treatment of this effect is possible for large quark masses, independent of the quark mass.
- The local effective Lagrangian for low energy is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\alpha_{S}N_{h}}{12\pi v}HF_{\mu \nu}^AF^{A\mu \nu} - \sum_{i=u,d,s} \frac{m_{i}}{\nu}H\bar{\psi}_{i}\psi_{i}
$$

- In the Lagrangian, $N_h$ represents the number of heavy flavors ($N_{h}=3$ for $c,t,b$) and $F_{\mu \nu}^A$ is the field strength tensor for gluons.
- The gluonic matrix elements needed are related to the energy-momentum tensor in QCD.
- The trace of the energy-momentum tensor allows writing the Higgs coupling in a useful form:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}} = -\frac{H}{v} \left(\frac{2}{9}\theta_{\mu}^\mu + \frac{7}{9}\sum_{i=u,d,s}m_{i}\bar{\psi}_{i}\psi\right)
$$

- The decay amplitude $H\to \pi \pi$ involves three kinematically independent form factors.
- The form factors are denoted as $\theta_{\pi}(s)$, $\Gamma_{\pi}(s)$, and $\Delta_{\pi}(s)$.
- Neglecting isospin breaking, the transition amplitude is given by:

$$
\bra{\pi^i(p)\pi^k(p^\prime)} \mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}} \ket{H} = -\frac{1}{v}G(s)\delta^{ik}
$$

- The function $G(s)$ is defined as:

$$
G(s) = \frac{2}{9}\theta_{\pi}(s) + \frac{7}{9}\left(\Gamma_{\pi}(s)+\Delta_{\pi}(s)\right)
$$

- The relative rate of decays into $\pi\pi$ vs. $\mu^+\mu^-$ is of interest.
- Summing over the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^0\pi^0$ possibilities, the ratio of the decay rates is given by

:

$$
\frac{\Gamma(H\to \pi \pi)}{\Gamma(H\to \mu^+\mu^-)} = \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{m_{H}}{m_{\mu}}\right)^2 \frac{(1-4m_{\pi}^2/m^2_{H})^{1/2}}{(1-4m_{\mu}^2/m^2_{H})^{1/2}} \left| G\left(\frac{m^2_{H}}{m^2_{H}}\right)\right|^2
$$

- For non-standard Higgs models, couplings can be modified by ratios of vacuum expectation values, mixing angles, etc.
- However, the modification only affects the weights of the operators ($\theta^\mu_{\mu}$, $m_{u}\bar{u}u$, etc.) in the effective Lagrangian.
- A general interaction is described by the effective Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}} = -\frac{H}{v} \left(K_{\theta}\theta^\mu_{\mu}+K_{u}m_{u}\bar{u}u+K_{d}m_{d}\bar{d}d+K_{s}m_{s}\bar{s}s+K_{\mu}m_{\mu}\bar{\mu}\mu+\cdots\right)
$$

- The branching ratio follows the form given in equation (8), with $G(s)$ expressed as:

$$
G(s) = \frac{1}{K_{\mu}} \left(K_{\theta}\theta_{\pi}(s) + \frac{K_{u}m_{u}+K_{d}m_{d}}{m_{u}+m_{d}}\Gamma_{\pi}(s) + K_{s}\Delta_{\pi}(s)\right)
$$
