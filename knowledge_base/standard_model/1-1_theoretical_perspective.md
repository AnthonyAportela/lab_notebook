The SM is a theory of fields with spins $0$, $\frac{1}{2}$, and $1$.
*Fermions* are excitations in the fermionic, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ spinor fields.
They come in *left* (L) and *right* (R) handed versions of the same field.
Altogether, they can be expressed as a big ol' vector containing the left-handed spinors.

$$
\begin{align}
\Psi_{L}^T = 
[     
  & ~q_{L1}, 
    ~u_{R1}^C, 
    ~e_{R1}^C,
    ~d_{R1}^C,
    ~l_{L1},
    ~n_{R1}^C,\\
  & ~q_{L2}, 
    ~u_{R2}^C, 
    ~e_{R2}^C,
    ~d_{R2}^C,
    ~l_{L2},
    ~n_{R2}^C,\\
  & ~q_{L3}, 
    ~u_{R3}^C, 
    ~e_{R3}^C,
    ~d_{R3}^C,
    ~l_{L3},
    ~n_{R3}^C
~]
\end{align}
$$

where the fields are quarks and leptons with threefold family replication (rows).
Why three families?
To answer, we need physics beyond the standard model.
So we don't know!





$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a,\mu\nu} + \sum_i(D_\mu \phi_i)^\dagger (D^\mu \phi_i) - \sum_f \bar{\psi}_f i\gamma^\mu D_\mu \psi_f - \sum_i \bar{\chi}_i i\gamma^\mu D_\mu \chi_i + h.c.
$$

$$
\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} = -\sum_{f}\lambda_f \bar{f}_L \phi f_R + h.c.
