The following notes closely follow the lectures titled **Field theory and the Standard Model** by *W. Buchmüller* and *C. Lüdeling*

The standard model (SM) has the following features:
- It is a theory of elementary particles and incorporates special relativity with quantum mechanics, thus it is a quantum field theory
- Its predictive power relies on regularization of divergent quantum corrections and the renormalization procedure which introduces scale-indapendant 'running couplings'.
- The electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational interactions are related to **local** symmetries, described by Abelian (commuting) and non-Abelian (non-commuting) gauge theories.
- A particle is either massless or gets its mass from one of two mechanisms
	- confinement
	- spontaneous symmetry breaking
