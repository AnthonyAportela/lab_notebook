Field Programable Gate Arrays. A class of hardware. The level between an [ASIC](ASICs) and a CPU/GPU. You can think of an FPGA as a programmable ASIC, where upon an array of gates can be configured on demand to perform a given task. 

The hierarchy of speed goes ASIC > FPGA > GPU > CPU.
The hierarchy of flexibility is reversed ASIC < FPGA < GPU < CPU.

Using the HLS compiler, we can compile human readable code to logic gates in the FPGAs
