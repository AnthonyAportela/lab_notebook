Earlier today I talked to Russel and got an idea for his [work flow](FPGA_deployment/Russell_workflow.md) for putting neural nets on [FPGAs](FPGAs) using the [APx framework](APx).

I think next I need to work through reliably deploying the trivial null algorithm.

My plan for next time will be to go through the [`hls4ml-tutorial`](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml-tutorial).
