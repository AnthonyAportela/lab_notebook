I got this message from Christian Herwig:
![](FPGA_deployment/img/christian_message_Wed_Apr_19_2023.png)

So I guess I need to copy this bash script to my directory and run it first. Let's see if that works. 
```sh
cd correlator-layer2
cp /home/therwig/setup_vitis_20222.sh .
```

I'll add some steps to my [APx tutorial](/knowledge_base/APx.md) to include this.

Ok, I got everything to work.
