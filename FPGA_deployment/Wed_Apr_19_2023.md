Ok, so far today I was able to clone the APx null algorithm. The issue was not having access to a couple of submodules as well as having an incorrectly configured ssh authetication for both gitlab and github. Tutorial for that [here](/knowledge_base/git_ssh_auth.md).

Ran into another issue with something to do with the python environment in corr4. Asked Christian about it.
